# 🎓 IndicScholar AI: The Multilingual AI Mentor

**Bridging the Education Gap across Bharat with Voice-First Intelligence.**

---

## 🌟 Project Overview
**IndicScholar AI** is an adaptive, voice-enabled educational mentor built for Indian students. It solves the "Language Barrier" by providing personalized tutoring, doubt-solving, and automated note-taking in 22+ regional Indian dialects.

### 🚩 The Problem
Millions of students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities lack access to high-quality personalized tutoring in their native languages. Most AI tools are English-centric, leaving vernacular-medium students behind.

### ✅ Our Solution
A 24/7 AI Mentor that:
- Explains complex concepts using local analogies.
- Translates academic content instantly into regional dialects.
- Tracks student progress to identify and fix learning gaps.

## ✨ Key Features
- **🎙️ Smart Doubt Solver:** Ask questions via voice in Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, etc., and get simple, analogy-based answers.
- **📝 Auto-Notes Generator:** Converts textbook photos or lecture audio into structured "Quick-Revision" summaries.
- **📊 Progress Tracker:** An AI-driven dashboard that identifies "Strength" and "Weakness" areas based on user history.
- **🎯 Adaptive Quizzing:** Generates custom quizzes focused specifically on a student’s weak topics.
